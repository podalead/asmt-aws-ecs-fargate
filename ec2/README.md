## Proposed Infrastructure Architecture

![design](design.jpg "Architecture")

* AWS Fargate
* AWS Application Load Balancer

The application load balancer should have an `/service` endpoint and `/__healthcheck__` health check endpoint.

If something is missing, feel free adding it to a solution.

## Objectives

The task objectives were as follows:

* Create infrastructure-as-code as per proposed Architecture
* `Makefile` has all the commands required to run/test
* Explain how to run in `README.md`

Optional

* Test Infrastructure (you can choose one or more test frameworks)
	* [Terraform BDD Testing](https://github.com/eerkunt/terraform-compliance)
	* [Terraform Unit Testing](https://github.com/bsnape/rspec-terraform)
	* [Terraform Ultimate Testing](https://github.com/bsnape/rspec-terraform)
## Before call start.sh script
Add envs with data to profile/<profile_name:test>/cred.txt:

#### THIS FILE MARKED AS IGNORED FOR GIT

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
```
     
In profile/<profile_name:test>/tf_vars.tfvars defined task required vars.

## Deploy

For start deploy use `make`

## Cleanup

For start cleanup use `make`

## Test the whole setup

For start tests `make`

## Note

Not make pull requests. Fork/Clone the repo instead and work on it. Master branches only.

There is no need to deploy infrastructure to AWS. Just make sure it fully valid terraform infrastructure-as-code setup.
